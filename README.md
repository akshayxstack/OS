**File System Optimization and Recovery Tool **

Is an open-source utility designed to improve filesystem performance, maintain integrity, and recover lost or damaged data. The tool combines optimization routines (like defragmentation, cleanup, and metadata tuning) with recovery capabilities (such as deleted file restoration and corrupted filesystem repair) to ensure storage systems run efficiently and reliably.
